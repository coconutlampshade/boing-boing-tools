<p>One of the best things about getting your first <a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/02/28/apple-deleted-files-that-i-own.html">Apple</a> computer is that it comes with all the productivity and creativity software most people need. Not having to shell out for photo editing software, a Microsoft 365 subscription, or even audio loops to start making music is part of what you get for paying the Apple Tax. Beyond the basics, Apple has offered premium pro-level apps for years — Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion. I love them because you can buy the software outright, no monthly fees like Adobe's competing products. But not everyone can afford to drop hundreds of bucks on software, especially after buying a new laptop.</p>

<p>Apple has figured this out. At the end of this month, the company will introduce Apple Creator Studio: $13 a month or $129 a year for bundled access to Pixelmator Pro, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, MainStage, Motion, Compressor, plus premium content for Keynote, Pages, and Freeform. You'll still be able to buy the software outright, and Apple's productivity apps will remain free with their basic functionality.</p>

<p>My hope is that Apple entering the subscription market forces Adobe to shake up its pricing. Any change would be good for creatives who rely on their software — less expensive options, more flexibility in cancellation. Adobe makes great software, but if they're no longer the only pay-as-you-go option, they'll have to compete.</p>

<p>For a young creator fresh out of university or a filmmaker working two jobs while making a documentary, a reasonably priced subscription to professional tools could be a game changer. Not everyone has $500 to drop on editing software. Provided Apple doesn't strip features from users who previously purchased these apps (like me), this could be a win-win. I'll always prefer owning my software outright. But when affordability allows creativity to flourish, I'm all for it.</p>
