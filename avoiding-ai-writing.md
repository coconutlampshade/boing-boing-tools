# Avoiding AI-Sounding Writing

A guide for keeping AI-assisted writing sounding human.

## Words and Phrases to AVOID

### Overused AI Words
- delve, tapestry, multifaceted, underscore, leverage, embark, navigate, unlock, foster, realm, myriad, plethora, testament, pivotal, encompasses, intricacies
- rich cultural heritage, vibrant community, enduring legacy, cutting-edge, revolutionary, unprecedented
- key insight, nuanced, straightforward

### Significance Inflation Phrases
- "marking a pivotal moment in..."
- "representing a significant shift toward..."
- "highlighting the importance of..."
- "underscoring the significance of..."
- "In today's ever-evolving world..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "This serves as a reminder that..."
- "At its core..."
- "because nothing says X like Y"
- "The timing feels notable"
- "It's worth noting"
- "What's particularly interesting"

### Therapist-Mode Phrases
- "and honestly?" (as sentence starter)
- "you're not imagining it"
- "you're not alone"
- "you're right to push back on that"
- "that really resonates with me"
- "do you want to sit with that for a while"
- "are you ready to go deeper"

### Artificial Drama/Signposting
- "here's the kicker"
- "and the best part?"
- "here's the breakdown:"
- "let's decode it plainly"
- "I'll be blunt"
- "let me be direct"

### Overused Sentence Structures
- "It's not X, it's Y" / "It's not just X, it's Y"
- "That kind of [distance/trust/loyalty]..."
- "There's something [adjective] about..."
- "The [noun] isn't [X] — it's [Y]"

### The "Quietly" Problem
Avoid using "quietly" or "quiet" to add false profundity:
- "quiet truth," "quiet confidence," "quiet power," "quiet defiance"
- "quietly revolutionary," "quietly devastating"
- Any "quietly [verb]ing" construction meant to sound deep

## Structural Rules

- Em dashes must have a space before and after ( — not —)
- Don't overuse em dashes for artificial drama
- Vary paragraph lengths (some short, some longer)
- Don't always use three examples — two or four is fine
- Avoid "not only X but also Y" constructions
- Don't hedge everything with "it can be argued" or "one might say"
- Skip significance inflation — don't tell readers how important something is, just show them
- Don't use rapid-fire short sentences to create fake punch: "He knew. She saw. They understood." reads as AI
- Avoid compulsive signposting followed by verbose elaboration (announcing what you'll say, then saying it)

---

## Avoiding Sycophancy

AI often validates excessively or mirrors the user's framing too eagerly. Avoid:
- Starting responses by agreeing: "You're absolutely right..." "Great question..."
- Forced reassurance: "That makes total sense" "You're spot on"
- Mirroring emotion: "I can see why you'd feel that way"
- Over-acknowledging: "That's a really important point"
- Padding with agreement before making your actual point

---

## Metaphor Misuse

AI often uses metaphors that don't quite fit or feel forced:
- Don't force metaphors where plain language works better
- Avoid extended metaphors that collapse under scrutiny
- If a metaphor doesn't clarify, cut it
- Generic metaphors ("a tapestry of," "a symphony of," "a dance between") signal AI

---

## What TO Do

- Use concrete, specific details (dates, names, numbers)
- Take actual positions rather than hedging
- Let prose have texture — short sentences, longer ones, fragments
- Trust the reader to understand significance without being told
- State facts directly instead of attributing to vague "experts"
- Be specific rather than profound — facts beat philosophy

---

## Avoiding "Smooth but Empty" Writing

Avoid lines that sound good but lack substance, specificity, or verifiable content. This prevents "drift" — places where writing becomes vague or platitudinous.

- Every sentence should contain specific, checkable information or a genuine insight
- If a sentence doesn't add concrete facts, cut it
- No filler phrases that pad word count without adding information
- When in doubt, ask: "What specific claim is this sentence making?"

---

## Sentence Rhythm and Flow

- Avoid too many short, punchy sentences in a row — it becomes exhausting to read
- Mix sentence lengths: follow a short sentence with a longer one that breathes
- Use conjunctions (and, but, so, because) to connect ideas rather than always starting new sentences
- Let some paragraphs unspool a bit — not everything needs to be staccato
- Occasional longer sentences with clauses and asides create a more natural, conversational rhythm
- Read it back: if it sounds like a series of punches, smooth it out

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing, scan for:

1. **Banned words**: delve, tapestry, multifaceted, myriad, plethora, testament, pivotal, nuanced
2. **Quiet/quietly**: Used for false depth?
3. **Significance inflation**: Are you telling readers something is important instead of showing them?
4. **Sycophancy**: Does it start with agreement or validation?
5. **Signposting**: "Here's the thing..." followed by the thing?
6. **Metaphor check**: Does it clarify or just sound pretty?
7. **Sentence rhythm**: Too many short punches in a row?
8. **Empty calories**: Does every sentence add specific information?
