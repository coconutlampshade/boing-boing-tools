<p>If you're looking for the most horrifying execution method in history, scaphism is a strong contender. Used by the ancient Persians, it involved trapping the condemned between two boats, covering them in milk and honey, and leaving them to be slowly devoured by insects over days or weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The procedure, as described by the Greek historian Plutarch, went like this: The victim was stripped and placed in a boat, then another boat was fitted on top to form a shell with holes cut for the head, hands, and feet. The exposed parts were covered in milk and honey to attract flies. More honey was poured into the victim's mouth to cause severe diarrhea, which would breed more insects inside the enclosure. The boats were then set afloat on a stagnant pond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Plutarch, one victim — a Persian soldier named Mithridates who had killed Cyrus the Younger — survived for 17 days before finally dying. The insects would breed in the festering wounds, eating the victim alive from the inside out. Death came from a combination of dehydration, starvation, septic shock, and being consumed by vermin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some historians debate whether scaphism was actually practiced or is simply Greek anti-Persian propaganda. The sources are all Greek, and ancient writers weren't above inventing barbaric customs to make their enemies look bad. Either way, someone imagined this in vivid detail, which says something about the human capacity for creative cruelty.</p>
