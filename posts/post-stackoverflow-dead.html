<p>For over a decade, Stack Overflow was the place where programmers went to find answers. If you Googled a coding error, you'd land on a Stack Overflow thread with a green checkmark next to the solution. Now that era is definitively over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monthly questions on the platform have cratered from over 200,000 in 2014 to just 3,862 in December 2025 — a 78 percent drop from the previous year alone, <a href="https://www.techzine.eu/news/devops/137686/stack-overflow-in-freefall-78-percent-drop-in-number-of-questions/">reports Techzine</a>. The culprit is obvious: 84 percent of developers now use AI coding assistants, and they don't need to wait for some stranger to tell them their question is a duplicate before closing the thread.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Reddit comments on this news are deliciously bitter. "GPT did a good job of summarizing Stack Overflow answers without the attitude," one user wrote. Another: "Died because the users are dicks. AI only helped locate the off ramp." The platform's notoriously hostile culture — where newbies were routinely humiliated for asking "basic" questions — may have sealed its fate long before ChatGPT arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's a dark irony here, though. AI systems learned to code by devouring Stack Overflow's archive of human-solved problems. Now that developers ask ChatGPT instead of posting publicly, solutions exist only in private chat histories. They're not indexed, not peer-reviewed, not available to the next person with the same bug. We're trading a searchable knowledge commons for ephemeral conversations with a language model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Stack Overflow the company is doing fine — <a href="https://sherwood.news/tech/stack-overflow-forum-dead-thanks-ai-but-companys-still-kicking-ai/">revenue hit $115 million last year</a>, up 17 percent. They're licensing that archive to the same AI companies killing their forum.</p>
