<article id="postBody">
<p>The Montague Street Bridge in South Melbourne has a clearance of just 3 metres — about 9 feet 10 inches — and it has been destroying overconfident trucks for over a century. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_Street_Bridge">Wikipedia</a>, witnesses reported vehicles hitting the bridge as far back as 1929, when a seven-year-old boy suggested they let the tyres down to free a stuck truck.</p>

<p>The Victorian Government has thrown everything at this problem. In 2016, they installed warning gantries with hanging paddles that physically hit any vehicle too tall to pass. They added 26 warning signs. Premier Daniel Andrews declared the bridge "fearless" and "undefeated," noting that each collision costs the economy roughly $100,000 in traffic delays plus $30,000 in emergency services and repairs. "If anyone manages to get stuck under this thing after that," Andrews said, "well, I give up."</p>

<p>More than a dozen vehicles have hit the bridge since those gantries went up. In May 2025, authorities reduced the speed limit from 60 to 40 km/h, hoping to give drivers more time to reconsider their life choices. Within days, the bridge was struck twice on consecutive days.</p>

<p>The bridge has its own Twitter account, written in first person. A website called How Many Days Since Montague Street Bridge Has Been Hit tracks each "championship title bout." And lowering the road or raising the bridge isn't feasible — there are water pipes, gas lines, and electricity cables underneath, plus the tram line running above. As youth website Pedestrian.tv once reported: "After 8 Months Dormant, The Awful Montague Street Bridge Has Awoken To Feed."</p>
