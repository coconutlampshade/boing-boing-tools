# Memeorandum Script

This script scrapes the 20 most recent headlines from memeorandum.com/river.

## Workflow

1. Run the `memeorandum` script to display the 20 most recent headlines with numbered options
2. User selects which articles they want posts about (e.g., "3, 7, 12")
3. For each selected article, fetch the full article content and generate a ~250 word blog post

## Blog Post Style

Write in the style of Boing Boing - conversational, witty, slightly irreverent, with a sense of wonder or outrage as appropriate. The tone should be:
- Engaging and opinionated
- Accessible to general readers
- Wry humor where appropriate
- Critical thinking about power structures

## Blog Post Format

Each post should:
- Be approximately 250 words
- Credit the original source naturally within the text (e.g., "As reported in the New York Times, ..." or "According to Politico, ...")
- Include a hyperlink to the original article
- Have a catchy headline
- Get to the interesting/important point quickly

## Example Attribution Styles

- "As reported in [The Washington Post](url), ..."
- "According to [Axios](url), ..."
- "[The Guardian reports](url) that ..."
- "Over at [Politico](url), they're reporting ..."
