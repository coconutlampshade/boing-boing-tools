<article id="postBody">
<p>In the 1970s, Gary Lachman — then Gary Valentine — played bass for Blondie, wrote the music for their first single "X-Offender," and lived with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in the band's legendary Bowery loft. His song "(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear" became a UK top ten hit.</p>

<p>Then he walked away from rock to write about consciousness and the occult. He's now published over 26 books on subjects ranging from Aleister Crowley to Colin Wilson.</p>

<p>This short film by his son Max Jones-Lachman traces the arc — from comic books at five, to Hermann Hesse as a teenager, to discovering esoteric traditions while living the New York punk life. It's promoting Lachman's new memoir, <em>Touched by the Presence</em>.</p>

<p>"It's about becoming who you are," Lachman says. "About bringing forth what is within you and actualizing your potentials."</p>
