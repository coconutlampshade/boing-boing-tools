<p>It's strange that the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent the world into lockdown seven years ago, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/03/18/snls-50th-celebration-sees-covid-19-spread-among-cast-and-guests.html">never ended</a>. It continues to kill and cripple us today—we simply stopped talking about it. Despite the death and those forced to live with the disease's lasting effects, the media (I'm as guilty as anyone at The New York Times) and governments moved on to shinier crises. We didn't have enough <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/covid19-ventilators-sharing-safe/">ventilators or beds</a>. Corpses <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-57154564">floated down rivers</a> in India. Bodies were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-us-news-ap-top-news-new-york-city-new-york-1b40d68e4969af9fa03e833afd24d709">stacked like sandbags in freezer trucks</a> as morgues overflowed. Doctors and nurses died in the same wards as patients they'd struggled to save days before.</p>

<p>It's hard to rekindle the fear and uncertainty I felt then. I was worried sick for my little chosen family. I recall driving Calgary's parkways and ring road after dusk during lockdown. Normally, the city—fast-growing and full of entitled drivers hungry to get home—was a sea of high-beams and road-stained metal. That evening, the roads were ours alone. For a moment, I thought it was funny that my phone shuffled to "Ghost Town" by the Specials. That moment passed quickly. It's easy to forget the terrible things we survived when facing new terrors we don't yet know how to navigate. We don't talk much about it, but the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/16/zjmv-j16.html">state of the pandemic right now</a> is… well, not great.</p>

<p>…the United States facing the 12th major wave of infections. Conservative estimates place cumulative COVID deaths in the United States at over 1.2 million, while excess-mortality analyses indicate a substantially higher toll. Globally, excess-mortality modeling places the true pandemic death toll in the tens of millions, with central estimates near 27 million worldwide, far exceeding official counts. Transmission continues at high rates—presently at roughly 1 million infections per day, with more than 240 million infections recorded in 2025 alone. Reinfections are widespread, and Long COVID remains a mass disabling condition affecting millions.</p>

<p>When I lay awake at night and the intrusive thoughts in my rotation recede long enough to hear other musings, I wonder how we can ever hope to take care of one another when we've been so quickly convinced not to take care of ourselves.</p>
