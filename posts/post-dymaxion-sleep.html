<p>"Sleep is just a bad habit." So declared Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, the Dymaxion car, and the Dymaxion house, in a 1943 TIME article announcing his latest innovation: Dymaxion sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fuller's theory was that humans have a primary store of energy that replenishes quickly and a secondary reserve that takes longer to restore. So instead of depleting both and crashing for eight hours, why not nap for 30 minutes as soon as your primary energy runs out — before you ever tap the reserves? He trained himself to recognize the first sign of fatigue (when his attention began to wander) and immediately take a half-hour nap. These intervals came about every six hours, meaning he slept just two hours total per day.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He kept this up for two years and reported "the most vigorous and alert condition I have ever enjoyed." Life insurance doctors examined him and found him "sound as a nut." The only reason he quit was that his business associates insisted on sleeping like normal people, and he couldn't coordinate schedules with them. Working for the Foreign Economic Administration during World War II, he reluctantly returned to conventional sleep — but told TIME he wished the nation's "key thinkers" could adopt his method. He was convinced it would shorten the war.</p>

<p>The article notes that sleep researchers of the era found some support for the idea: studies showed sleepers are quietest in the first two hours, then grow progressively more restless. A Colgate University study found people awakened after four hours were just as alert and resistant to fatigue as those who slept eight — though they did lose accuracy and concentration. Fuller, characteristically, wasn't interested in half measures.</p>
