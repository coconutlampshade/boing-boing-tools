<p>Before the Sistine Chapel ceiling, before the David, before any of the masterworks that would make him a legend, a preteen Michelangelo was painting demons. <em>The Torment of Saint Anthony</em> shows the desert hermit besieged by grotesque creatures — and the kid who painted it was maybe 12 or 13 years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The painting spent five centuries as a nobody's work until a buyer brought it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008 for cleaning. Conservators scraped away the grime and found something unexpected: a color palette and approach to human figures that looked a lot like the Sistine Chapel. Infrared imaging revealed <em>pentimenti</em> — correction marks showing the artist was making creative decisions, not just copying someone else's work.</p>

<p>The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth took the leap, with its director finding "not a single convincing argument against the attribution." Art historian Giorgio Bonsanti later backed up the claim, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/discover-michelangelos-first-painting.html">reports Open Culture</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's now the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas and one of just four easel paintings attributed to him — fitting, since he later trash-talked oil painting as a medium. Some scholars remain skeptical, and Michelangelo himself probably would have dismissed it as juvenilia. But there's something undeniably compelling about seeing a future master's work from when he was still young enough to be grounded for staying out too late.</p>
