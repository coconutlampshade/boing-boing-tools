<article id="postBody">
<p>Those two small indentations some people have on their lower back, just above the buttocks, have a proper anatomical name: the dimples of Venus, after the Roman goddess of beauty. In Latin, they're called fossae lumbales laterales, or "lateral lumbar indentations." When the same feature appears on men, they're technically called "dimples of Apollo," though almost nobody uses that term.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimples_of_Venus">Wikipedia</a>, the dimples mark the sacroiliac joints, where your spine connects to your pelvis. They're created by a short ligament stretching between bone and skin, and they're largely genetic — you either have them or you don't, though body fat percentage affects how visible they are. Research suggests they're most prominent at around 22 percent body fat in women and 32 percent in men.</p>

<p>Surgeons actually use these dimples as landmarks when placing screws during spine surgery, so they have genuine medical utility beyond aesthetics. Studies have looked for connections between the dimples and lower back pain but found no statistically significant correlation.</p>

<p>The name has been accepted within the medical profession for so long that nobody knows who first made the connection to Venus. Presumably someone thought they were attractive enough to warrant a divine association. In the 2010s, the dimples became a popular spot for transdermal piercings — small jewelry embedded in the skin. The goddess of beauty probably didn't see that coming, but beauty standards have always been weird.</p>
