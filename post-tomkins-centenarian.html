<article id="postBody">
<p>Calvin Tomkins was born on December 17, 1925 — the same year The New Yorker began publishing. He's been a staff writer there since 1960, profiling artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Marcel Duchamp. As he approached his centennial, he decided to keep a journal of his 100th year. The New Yorker published the result, a clear-eyed account of what it actually feels like to become very old.</p>

<p>According to The New Yorker, Tomkins writes about the accumulating losses with remarkable candor: macular degeneration that makes reading difficult, memory lapses that frustrate him, the constant awareness that time is running short. "I sometimes think that the main thing I do these days is look for things," he writes. His wife Dodie, 93, helps him navigate the practical challenges — she reads to him, handles correspondence, keeps track of the details that slip away.</p>

<p>The journal captures both the indignities and the unexpected pleasures of extreme age. Tomkins still swims, still attends gallery openings, still cares deeply about art. He recalls his decades of work with genuine satisfaction rather than nostalgia. When young people ask about his career, he tells them he's had "an absurdly good time."</p>

<p>On Thanksgiving 2025, Tomkins suffered a stroke. The journal doesn't end there — it continues through his recovery, documenting what remains and what doesn't. "I'm not afraid of dying," he writes at one point. "I just don't want to miss anything."</p>
