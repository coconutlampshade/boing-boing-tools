<p>Browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellworn/">r/Wellworn</a> will fill your screen with delightfully used items. From bars of soap worn into interesting shapes to clothing and stuffies loved into rags, each item tells a story. Many have a character and soul that makes brand-new items look dull in comparison.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellworn/comments/1pg7yz7/i_got_a_100_year_old_penny_in_change/#lightbox">penny from 1916</a> that has lost most of its detail. I like thinking about how this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellworn/comments/1q75hzq/pole_with_years_of_staples/#lightbox">telephone pole with years of staples</a> has had thousands of concert posters, ads, and fliers attached to it. Here's a naturally well-worn item: a gorgeous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellworn/comments/1q9ral7/this_rock_eroded_by_the_waves/#lightbox">rock eroded by waves</a>.</p>

<p>I'd love to see an art exhibit curating well-worn items like these. It can feel nice to get rid of junk, but consider holding onto things that feel uniquely worn-out. Or at least upload a photo to the subreddit before letting go.</p>
