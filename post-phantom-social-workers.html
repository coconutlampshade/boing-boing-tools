<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the early 1990s, reports began surfacing across the UK and United States of mysterious strangers posing as social workers, showing up at homes and attempting to examine or abduct children. Police took the reports seriously. Parents were terrified. The media ran wall-to-wall coverage. There was just one problem: none of it was real.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between 1990 and 1994, UK police received over 250 reports of these "phantom social workers." Despite extensive investigations, not a single case resulted in an actual abduction or even a confirmed sighting that could be corroborated. The pattern was always the same: someone claiming to be a social worker would appear at a door, ask to inspect a child, and leave when challenged. But actual social workers carry ID and don't make unannounced visits alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sociologists who studied the phenomenon found it fit the pattern of a "moral panic" — a wave of fear spreading through a community, amplified by media coverage, feeding on itself. The phantom social workers emerged during the same era as the Satanic Panic, when parents were primed to see threats to children everywhere. Some researchers noted that the reports peaked after media coverage, suggesting people were interpreting mundane encounters through a lens of fear.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The panic eventually faded, leaving behind a case study in how fear spreads. No children were harmed by phantom social workers because there were no phantom social workers — just anxious parents, amplifying media, and the eternal human tendency to see patterns in noise.</p>
