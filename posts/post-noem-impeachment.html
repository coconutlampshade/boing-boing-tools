<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most of the past year, Democrats who floated impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem were on the fringes. Then ICE shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good was a U.S. citizen, a mother of three, and according to city officials, a legal observer monitoring federal immigration enforcement. DHS called her actions "domestic terrorism." President Trump claimed she "ran over" an officer — but videos posted to social media don't show that happening. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey reviewed the footage and told ICE to "get the f*** out of Minneapolis."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now impeachment is going mainstream. Rep. Robin Kelly announced three articles of impeachment alleging Noem abused her office for personal benefit, obstructed congressional oversight, and directed unconstitutional actions that compromised public safety. More significantly, Rep. Brad Schneider — chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition — said Friday that if Noem isn't ousted over the Minneapolis and Portland shootings, he's "prepared to support congressional action, up to and including impeachment." Reps. Betty McCollum, Sean Casten, and Sarah McBride have come out for impeachment outright.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Removal remains unlikely. Democrats are in the minority, and Trump has backed the ICE officer's conduct. But the speed at which mainstream Democrats have moved from dismissing impeachment talk to embracing it suggests the political ground has shifted.</p>
