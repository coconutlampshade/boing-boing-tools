<h1>Justice Department has released less than 1% of Epstein files</h1>

<p>The Justice Department told a federal judge this week that it has released approximately 12,285 documents — about 125,575 pages — from its Jeffrey Epstein files. That sounds like a lot until you learn there are more than 2 million documents still "in various phases of review." According to CBS News, the department has processed <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epstein-files-doj-says-it-has-reviewed-less-than-1-percent-so-far/">less than 1% of its total Epstein records</a>.</p>

<p>The legal deadline to release these files was December 12. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave DOJ 30 days to publish a wide range of documents, including decades-old records from the earliest federal investigations, files from the 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and materials from the department's review of Epstein's death in custody. They blew right past it.</p>

<p>The department argues the volume is simply too massive — they need to find, upload, review, and redact millions of pages before publication. More than 400 DOJ lawyers are currently working on the effort. But at this pace, assuming everything eventually gets released, the entire process would take over eight years to complete. That timeline would extend well past any Trump administration.</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has accused the department of a cover-up. Epstein survivors and congressional Democrats have criticized both the pace and the missed deadline.</p>

<p>When you promise transparency on one of the most notorious sex trafficking cases in American history and then announce it'll take nearly a decade to deliver, people start asking uncomfortable questions.</p>
