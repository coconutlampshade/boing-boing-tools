<p>In medieval France, when a pig killed a child, the animal didn't just get slaughtered. It got a trial. According to Popular Science, these were formal legal proceedings with judges, defense attorneys, and — in at least one case — a pig that spent five years in prison awaiting execution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The practice sounds like peasant superstition, but historians say it was more calculated than that. Medieval pigs were nothing like modern domesticated hogs. They were closer to wild boars — fast, strong, and omnivorous in the most disturbing sense. "They ate everything, including human meat sometimes," explains historian Sven Gins. When children were left unattended near these animals, tragedies happened with grim regularity.</p>

<p>The trials served multiple purposes beyond revenge. Courts investigated whether negligence or foul play was involved. Formal proceedings replaced simple monetary settlements when deaths occurred, providing a sense of closure. Lords used the spectacle to demonstrate their judicial authority. And for the theologically minded, executing an animal that had consumed human flesh restored the divine order of things.</p>

<p>Some cases are remarkably well documented. In 1457, a sow killed five-year-old Jehan Martin in Savigny, Burgundy; her piglets were found covered in blood but ultimately acquitted for lack of direct evidence. The mother pig was not so lucky. These weren't kangaroo courts — they were slow, deliberate, and deadly serious about giving a pig its day in court before hanging it.</p>
