<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media posts calling for a Chipotle boycott claimed the company's owner or CEO donated $10,000 to $15,000 to a GoFundMe supporting ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chipotle-owner-ice-donation/">Snopes rated the claim false</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The confusion: billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman did donate $10,000 to the Ross fundraiser. His firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, previously held a major stake in Chipotle starting in 2017. But here's the thing — Pershing Square completely divested from Chipotle by November 2025, before the shooting and donation occurred.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bill Ackman is not affiliated with Chipotle and is no longer a shareholder of the Company," a Chipotle spokesperson told Newsweek. The company's actual CEO, Scott Boatwright, didn't appear among top donors to the Ross fundraiser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ackman is a controversial figure worth boycotting for his own reasons — but his personal donation isn't a Chipotle donation. The viral posts conflated a former investor's individual contribution with corporate giving. Chipotle has plenty of documented labor issues worth criticism; a fabricated ICE connection isn't one of them.</p>
