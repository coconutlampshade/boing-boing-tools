<p>AI deepfakes are one of the great societal growing pains of our time. They distort reality, hijack individual currency for entertainment and public humiliation, and could cost people who make a living off their face or voice serious money. In the US and Europe, it's already illegal for companies to use someone's likeness to sell products without permission. But with AI's ease and speed in replicating voices and appearances, fly-by-night companies still try to profit off celebrity by creating false endorsements. Professional face user Matthew McConaughey is trying to get ahead of this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew McConaughey filed trademark applications to prevent his likeness from being used by AI companies without permission, and the US Patent and Trademark Office has approved eight so far. According to the Wall Street Journal, the trademarks cover video and audio clips of the actor staring, smiling, and talking. One protects a video of him standing on a porch, while another covers an audio recording of him saying "alright, alright, alright," his signature catchphrase from Dazed and Confused.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McConaughey's lawyer admits to the Wall Street Journal that neither he nor his client knows whether the trademarks would actually help in court battles over his voice or likeness. But it certainly can't hurt. Interestingly, as Engadget points out, ol' Russ Coe isn't anti-AI. McConaughey owns a stake in <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">ElevenLabs</a>, an AI company specializing in platforms that generate convincing artificial voice agents and AIs to replace actors for audiobooks and voiceover work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given his inside track on voice work's uncanny valley, McConaughey's legal footwork to secure his image and distinct speaking style might signal it's about to get even harder to tell what's real online and what's just more slop.</p>
