<p>Civilization 7 is far from my favourite instalment in the long-running, time-sucking 4X strategy series. I had a hard time getting into the way it forces you to start fresh with every new era your civilization enters — it made the game feel like it lacked continuity. But lots of people love it! Enough of them, in fact, for <a href="https://www.bhvr.com">Behaviour Interactive</a>—the studio behind <a href="https://boingboing.net/2015/06/16/fallout-shelter-makes-you-shut.html">Fallout Shelter</a>—to spend its time porting it to Apple's tablets and smartphones. According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-is-finally-coming-to-mobile-exclusively-on-apple-arcade/1100-6537392/">GameSpot</a>, there are currently no plans for an Android port.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Apple Arcade edition will feature touch-specific controls for on-the-go play. And if it's anything like the excellent port of Civilization 6, it should keep most of the in-game elements from the PC version. The burning question: how long will it be an Apple Arcade exclusive? Plenty of iPhone owners would buy a license outright but have no interest in a monthly Arcade subscription.</p>

<p>It's also worth wondering how many future desktop-class AAA games Apple will confine to their subscription service. As the company moves to powering its portable devices with the same chips as their computers, bringing big-name games to Apple hardware might actually become tempting for studios. With the news this week that Apple is launching a subscription service to counter Adobe's creative suite, I wouldn't put it past Tim Cook and the gang to put the games Apple users want behind a monthly paywall. With hardware sales declining as production costs rise, forcing subscriptions on customers is key to the company making its next trillion bucks.</p>
