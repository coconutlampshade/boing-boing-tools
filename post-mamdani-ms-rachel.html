<p>This past Friday, Mayor of New York Zohran Mamdani joined educator and <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/8/13/ms_rachel">Gaza advocate</a> Rachel Griffin Accurso, also known as Ms. Rachel, to sing to several dozen children at a school in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After singing "The Wheels on the Bus," they discussed feelings with the children, ABC 7 NY <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-mayor-zohran-mamdani-spends-morning-ms-rachel-singing-kids-lower-manhattan-school/18377529/">reports</a>. The mayor said he's feeling happy because he just <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/governor-hochul-mayor-mamdani-set-talk-funding-universal-child-care-new-york-state/18371527/">announced universal child care for every 2-year-old</a>. "Giving makes us so happy, and giving child care makes everyone really happy in the city," Ms. Rachel said. They went on to sing "If You're Happy and You Know It" and were surprised by a visit from Herbie, Ms. Rachel's comfort doll.</p>

<p>The whole visit, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-NuVg-Fp0">here</a>, is delightful. It's terrific to see public figures who seem so happy sharing positivity with others and who seem to genuinely care about people.</p>

<p>Shortly after, some clever folks online created a meme that's the perfect response to right-wing whining. The clip starts right when they're singing about the baby on the bus going "wah, wah, wah," while pretending to wipe crocodile tears from their eyes. Parker Molloy first <a href="https://x.com/ParkerMolloy/status/2009764449964458266">posted</a> the clip, writing, "I feel like this video clip/GIF will get a lot of use," and someone quickly followed up with a <a href="https://x.com/MurdoinkGS/status/2010161114508865644">green screen version</a>. Some additions are already internet gold — like <a href="https://x.com/__exige__/status/2010271665461313844">this one</a> superimposing Mamdani wah-wah-wah-ing over Trump complaining about not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As someone <a href="https://x.com/MurdoinkGS/status/2010161114508865644">commented</a>, "This will feed generations."</p>
