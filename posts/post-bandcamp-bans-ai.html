<p>If it wasn't the ICE recruitment ads that drove you off Spotify, it was probably the deluge of AI slop pushed by the platform. If I have to see another album some guy generated and published under <a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/silent-hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Akira Yamaoka</a>'s name, I'm going to lose it.</p>

<p>At least one music service is taking the right stance, even given <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/11/06/bandcamp-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-violation-against-new-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their other missteps</a>. Per a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BandCamp/comments/1qbw8ba/ai_generated_music_on_bandcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent announcement on Reddit</a>, Bandcamp has banned all AI-generated material:</p>

<p>Something that always strikes us as we put together a roundup like this is the sheer quantity of human creativity and passion that artists express on Bandcamp every single day. The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, in line with that goal, we're articulating our policy on generative AI. We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our guidelines for generative AI in music and audio are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is <strong>not permitted</strong> on Bandcamp. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you encounter music or audio that appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI, please use our reporting tools to flag the content for review by our team. We reserve the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated.</p>

<p>Weird union-busting efforts from <a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/bandcamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandcamp</a>'s various owners aside, this announcement <em>and</em> the fact that they actually pay their artists rockets them to the top of my list. There's already more music than you could ever listen to; you don't need to add soulless algorithmic stuff to the pile.</p>
