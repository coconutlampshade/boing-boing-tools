<p>Jayden Scott, the 23-year-old Michigan man who went viral for taunting protesters at the site where ICE shot and killed a woman, is now facing a warrant threat after failing to report for jail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scott appeared in video footage from Minneapolis on January 8, one day after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during an immigration operation. Using a bullhorn, he shouted "We executed one of you yesterday" at demonstrators and declared "The storm is here. When we come, no one can stop what is coming."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem for Scott: he was already supposed to be dealing with legal trouble back home. A Bay County judge had sentenced him to seven days in jail for skipping a child custody hearing. When Scott appeared at a Wednesday court hearing via Zoom — from Minnesota, where he announced he was "returning to bring more people there to help ICE" — the judge ordered him to report to Bay County Jail by Friday, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw-bay-city/2026/01/michigan-judge-threatens-warrant-after-bay-city-man-misses-jail-date-following-viral-minnesota-rally-appearance.html">reports MLive</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fallout from Scott's viral moment has been swift. He resigned as CEO of Harmony Investment Group, a Troy-based healthcare investment firm. He was fired from Anthony Hudson's Michigan gubernatorial campaign. And he's no longer on the executive committee of the Bay County Republican Party. In his resignation statement, Scott said the board and he "have different views of the future of America."</p>
