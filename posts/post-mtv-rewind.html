<p>Before it became a dumping ground for terrible reality TV, MTV was a cultural phenomenon. If you didn't grow up with it, the impact is hard to convey. The constant stream of music videos made our relationship with music feel immediate, intimate. Musicians were no longer confined to trade publications and teen magazines — you could watch them sweat and sing (often badly) from your living room. And filling 24 hours of programming meant giving airtime to metal, rap, and alternative acts like Mojo Nixon and Public Enemy, pulling them from college radio's fringes into the <a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/09/08/median-age-of-mtv-viewers-is-56.html">national spotlight</a>. Before YouTube existed, MTV opened the world to music video directors and actors who'd go on to major careers.</p>

<p>Nothing lasts. As YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok became the preferred delivery method for music videos, MTV's relevance faded as fast as its ratings. At the end of 2025, after nearly 45 years on the air, MTV shut down. But you can still experience its glory days.</p>

<p><a href="https://wantmymtv.xyz/player.html">MTV Rewind</a> is an absolute wonder. It collects over 33,000 music videos, shows, and exclusive concert footage spanning the station's four decades. Want Pop Up Video? No problem. An MTV Unplugged concert you haven't seen in ages? Sorted. Need to show a millennial how truly terrible early '80s music videos were? This is your resource. The site is searchable, well-organized, and captures the fun, rebellious aesthetic that MTV packaged and sold us when we were growing up. I've spent hours on it over the past few days. You'll dig it too.</p>
