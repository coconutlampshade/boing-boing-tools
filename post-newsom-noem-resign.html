<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign Thursday following two shooting incidents involving federal officers this week. "Kristi Noem should resign — before more Americans are killed," Newsom's office said. "She needs to be held to account."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to The Hill, Newsom's statement comes after ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday, and after Border Patrol agents shot two people in Portland, Oregon the following day. Good was a U.S. citizen and mother of three who city officials say was acting as a legal observer monitoring federal immigration enforcement.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noem called the Minneapolis incident an "act of domestic terrorism," claiming Good "attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle." But multiple videos of the encounter show Good driving away from — not toward — the officer when he opened fire, contradicting the administration's account. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to "get the f*** out of Minneapolis" after reviewing the footage.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has also called for Noem's resignation. "Firing their weapons at peaceful citizens. Killing innocent people. Kristi Noem must go. Now," Pritzker wrote on social media. Rep. Robin Kelly has announced plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Noem. The list of Democratic officials demanding accountability is growing daily.</p>
