<p>In the 1960s, the sugar industry paid Harvard researchers the equivalent of $50,000 to publish a literature review that downplayed sugar's role in heart disease and pointed the finger at fat and cholesterol instead. According to <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/09/404081/sugar-papers-reveal-industry-role-shifting-national-heart-disease-focus">UCSF researchers</a> who discovered internal industry documents in public archives, the funding and the industry's involvement were never disclosed in the published paper.</p>

<p>The 1967 study appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine and concluded that reducing dietary cholesterol and increasing polyunsaturated fats were the only necessary steps to prevent heart disease. Sugar got a pass. The paper shaped both public opinion and scientific consensus for decades, influencing dietary guidelines that steered Americans away from fat and toward carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Internal documents show the sugar trade organization knew as early as 1954 that if Americans adopted low-fat diets, per-capita sugar consumption would increase by more than a third. When media coverage of the sugar-heart disease connection spiked in 1965, the industry launched "Project 226" — the Harvard literature review designed to shift the narrative.</p>

<p>UCSF's Stanton Glantz, who has spent decades studying tobacco industry tactics, noted the parallels: "There are all kinds of ways that you can subtly manipulate the outcome of a study, which industry is very well practiced at." The sugar industry borrowed from the tobacco playbook — fund friendly research, bury inconvenient findings, manufacture doubt. It worked for 50 years.</p>
