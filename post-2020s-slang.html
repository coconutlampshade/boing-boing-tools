<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_2020s_slang">Wikipedia maintains a glossary of 2020s slang</a>, a living document attempting to catalog terms like "rizz" (charisma, especially romantic), "skibidi" (nonsense filler from a viral video series), "no cap" (no lie), and "brainrot" (the state of losing touch with reality from consuming too much online content, often diagnosed by excessive use of terms like "skibidi").</p>

<p>The page notes that much of what's considered Gen Z slang actually originated in African-American Vernacular English and ball culture before going mainstream through TikTok and other platforms. The Washington Post has described this era as producing "an unprecedented variety of linguistic variation," which is one way to describe watching teenagers call AI chatbots "clankers."</p>

<p>Some highlights: "aura" now means your overall vibe, and cultivating it is called "aura farming." To "cook" is to perform well, but to be "cooked" means you're in trouble. "Bffr" is an acronym for "be fucking for real." If someone is "caught in 4K," they've been indisputably recorded doing something wrong. A "beige flag" is a personality trait that's neither good nor bad.</p>

<p>Self-deprecating irony runs through much of it. The glossary will presumably baffle future generations, assuming they can find it between the digital ruins of platforms that no longer exist. It's a snapshot of how a generation communicated during the specific years when algorithms shaped language faster than any previous technology. Future linguists will have their work cut out for them.</p>
