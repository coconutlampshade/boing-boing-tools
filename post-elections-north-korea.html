<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>North Korea holds elections every four to five years for its Supreme People's Assembly. The process is a masterclass in authoritarian theater. Each district has exactly one candidate, pre-selected by the government. There's no option to write in alternatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's how voting works: you receive a ballot with a single name on it. To vote "yes," you simply drop the ballot in the box unmarked. To vote "no," you must request a pen and cross out the candidate's name — in full view of election officials. Your vote is not anonymous, and those who cross out names face legal and professional consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Official turnout figures hover around 100%. The government treats election day as a census of sorts — if you don't show up, authorities come looking for you. The whole exercise exists to give the regime a veneer of democratic legitimacy while functioning as a loyalty test and population count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wikipedia's article on North Korean elections is a fascinating look at how autocracies maintain the trappings of democracy while hollowing out every meaningful aspect of it. The single-candidate ballot with public "no" voting is almost elegant in its cynicism.</p>
