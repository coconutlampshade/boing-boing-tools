<p>It's everyone's favorite time of year again — time to order Girl Scout Cookies! As usual, Erin Reed, who runs the "<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com">Erin in the Morning</a>" Substack, has published a <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/2026-trans-girl-scouts-to-order-cookies">list</a> of trans and nonbinary Girl Scouts you can order your 2026 cookies from. Erin writes, "this year, consider ordering your Girl Scout Cookies from a trans girl scout to make their day!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Girl Scouts organization has openly welcomed nonbinary and trans members for years. Five years ago, in the midst of a wave of anti-trans sentiment that has only grown stronger since, Erin decided to start seeking out trans Girl Scouts to support during cookie season. They <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/2026-trans-girl-scouts-to-order-cookies">describe</a> the success:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My initial effort was a success, meeting the goals of every single scout featured on the page. The achievement felt wonderful during what seemed like one of the most severe legislative attacks on transgender children in recent memory. Unbeknownst to us, each subsequent year would bring greater such attacks. Since then, every year I've repeated this initiative, we've surpassed our previous sales, leading to coverage in multiple major media outlets. Last year, scouts on our list sold 50,000+ Girl Scout Cookies!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/2026-trans-girl-scouts-to-order-cookies">post</a> includes the goals, interests, and hobbies of almost ninety Girl Scouts (and counting). There's also a form to submit info about your trans scout if you want them included. More scouts will be added over the coming weeks, so check back often. As always, please buy from scouts who haven't already filled their goals.</p>
