<p>Before refrigerators, rural communities in Russia and Finland faced a problem: how to keep milk from spoiling. Their solution was to drop a live brown frog (<em>Rana temporaria</em>) into the jar. This practice, common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, was passed down through generations. People observed that milk stayed fresh longer with a frog present, though they didn't understand why. I wouldn't recommend trying it today, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSSeyFgDkwJ/">Got Weird on Instagram</a> has the science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Modern research has vindicated the folklore. A 2012-2013 study led by Dr. Albert Lebedev at Moscow State University found that brown frog skin secretes potent antimicrobial peptides — natural antibiotic compounds that inhibit bacteria and fungi. These compounds, including one called Brevinin 1Tb, proved effective against harmful bacteria like <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Salmonella</em>. The frog was essentially acting as nature's preservative.</p>

<p>It's a reminder that folk wisdom sometimes has real biochemistry behind it — an ingenious, if unwitting, application of natural science that helped people preserve a vital food source before technology caught up.</p>
