<p>This whimsical <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTOICLhjYuy/">Snail House</a> (photo taken and shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTOICLhjYuy/">Stefano Perego</a> on Instagram) is as much sculpture as home. This delightful five-story house in Bulgaria was designed by architect Simeon Simeonov in 2008. The vibrantly colored, striped snail with its cartoon face reportedly has no right angles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Snail House sits in a residential neighborhood and appeals to creative souls. Though it's not in a touristy area, people visit the Simeonovo neighborhood specifically to see this snail-shaped beauty. The entire house is made from eco-friendly materials, making it even cooler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Living in the Snail House seems like a wonderful adventure. I want to watch a documentary about whoever lives inside it now and what their day-to-day life inside a giant snail is like. My favorite detail: air and gas vent out of the snail's eyeballs (zoom in and you'll notice the small red radiators coming down from the snail's eyelids).</p>
