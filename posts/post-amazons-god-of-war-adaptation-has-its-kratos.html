<p>Hey, remember that live-action God of War show Amazon <a href="https://boingboing.net/2022/12/15/god-of-war-is-getting-a-live-action-amazon-prime-video-series.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced more than three years ago</a>? No? I didn't either until just now, but it's been chugging along behind the scenes without our knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the <em>Fallout</em> TV show turned out pretty damn good, I'm less leery of future video game adaptations from Amazon Studios. God of War is probably <em>another</em> few years out, but <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ryan-hurst-tapped-to-play-kratos-in-prime-videos-i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon announced</a> a substantial step: actor Ryan Hurst was cast as Kratos of Sparta.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hurst played Thor in PlayStation's <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, bringing established familiarity with the franchise to the role of Kratos. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thor is the only role I know Hurst from offhand, but he absolutely crushed it, and familiarity with the series is obviously a plus. While casting the main character is a big deal, the press release included bonus details, some juicier than others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lightning round: <em>Wheel of Time</em>'s Rafe Judkins is out as showrunner, with <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>'s Ronald D. Moore stepping up. Cory Barlog, director of the much-loved 2018 <em>God of War</em> reboot, is serving as executive producer. The entire series seems to adapt that game in particular, according to an official synopsis:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>God of War,</em> the live action series, his story will closely follow the path of the last two games as he deals with something new: his ten year old son Atreus. This father and son dynamic began a whole new chapter in the legendary series and will be the heartbeat of the new show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still no word on Atreus' casting. I'm a little disappointed they're adapting a pre-existing story instead of telling a new one in the setting — I hate to point to <em>Fallout</em> again, but that show's approach was an absolute slam dunk. Kratos has been around for centuries; surely he's gotten into <em>some</em> other mischief worthy of being put onscreen.</p>
