<p>In 1940, the Nazis hatched a scheme so audacious it sounds like rejected Bond villain plotting: flood Britain with forged banknotes dropped from aircraft, triggering hyperinflation and economic collapse. The operation, codenamed Unternehmen Andreas (later Operation Bernhard), was run by the Sicherheitsdienst, the SS intelligence service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The technical achievement was genuinely impressive. German forgers successfully duplicated the rag paper used in British currency, produced near-identical engraving blocks, and — here's the kicker — reverse-engineered the algorithm the Bank of England used to generate serial numbers. Each fake note had a unique, valid-looking serial code.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initial air-drop plan was eventually abandoned, but the operation continued. Concentration camp prisoners with backgrounds in printing and banking were forced to produce the forgeries. By war's end, they'd manufactured around £132 million in fake notes — roughly £6 billion in today's money. Some of this funny money actually entered circulation, used to pay German agents and buy supplies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whole enterprise collapsed in early 1942 when its head, Alfred Naujocks, fell out of favor with Reinhard Heydrich. The Bank of England responded by withdrawing all notes over £5 from circulation, a policy that lasted until 1945. Wikipedia has the full story of this bonkers economic warfare attempt.</p>
