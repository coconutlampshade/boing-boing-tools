<p>Forget apps and smart displays. The most elegant kitchen calculator is a mechanical device from the 1600s. <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/kitchen-slide-rule">Entropic Thoughts makes the case</a> for keeping a slide rule in your kitchen drawer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem: cooking constantly demands proportion adjustments. You have 2 cups of flour but the recipe calls for 3.3. How much of everything else do you need? Set your slide rule to that ratio and it becomes a custom scaling table — find any ingredient amount on one scale, read the adjusted amount directly below it. No tapping, no scrolling, no ads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The magic is logarithms. When you set a slide rule to a proportion like 2:3.3, it simultaneously displays every equivalent ratio (1:1.65, 14:23.1, and so on). One physical adjustment gives you infinite conversions. Professional bakers have long normalized recipes to flour weight, expressing all ingredients proportionally — a practice the slide rule supports without batteries or WiFi passwords.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond simple scaling, a slide rule helps you compare recipes. Line up the flour amounts from three different bread recipes and instantly see how their butter, sugar, and salt ratios differ. You'll quickly learn which ingredients demand precision and which are added to taste. It's the kind of intuitive understanding that gets buried when you outsource all math to a phone.</p>
