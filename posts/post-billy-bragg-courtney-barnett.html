<p>Every few months, my algorithm serves up one utterly delightful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yg6xDAekPI">video</a>: Billy Bragg singing The Velvet Underground's "Sunday Morning" with Courtney Barnett. It appeared again just now on what is indeed, currently, for me, Sunday morning. I find their performance to be pure, joyful perfection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original "Sunday Morning" was <a href="https://medialoper.com/certain-songs-3048-the-velvet-underground-sunday-morning/">released</a> as a single by the Velvet Underground and Nico in 1966 and appears as the opening track on their 1967 debut. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yg6xDAekPI">version</a> was recorded on May 5, 2014, at RocKwiz, an Australian music-themed TV trivia show featuring guest artists performing with the house band. It was just two years after Barnett's first EP and a year before her breakthrough album <em>Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their voices blend beautifully, and I have to say, I prefer their version to the original. I adore how gleeful Courtney looks performing with such a legend — she keeps glancing at Billy with wide, happy eyes and a big smile. One commenter agreed: "Every 15 seconds or so, Courtney goes 'Ahhhh I'm performing with Billy Bragg,' and just looks so happy."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's also heart-warming to see how supportive Billy is throughout. And Courtney's guitar solo is genuinely fire. They really are perfect together.</p>
