<p>I just found a new opossum to obsess over! Meet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQCg-xDCQ4e/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Mama Odie</a>, a sweet opossum who lives at the Keeper of the Wild Wildlife Rescue and Sanctuary, a non-profit <a href="https://keeperofthewild.org">organization</a> that has been "dedicated to the conservation, preservation, and rehabilitation of South Carolina's wildlife" for over thirty years. She came into the rescue in 2024 after being injured and losing her eyesight, probably in a dog attack. She had two tiny babies in her pouch when she arrived, likely having lost the rest of her litter in the attack. Samantha MacDougal, a volunteer at the sanctuary, explained to <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/blind-mama-opossum-cries-out-for-the-sweetest-reason">The Dodo</a> that Mama Odie was in mourning after losing her babies, so she came up with the idea of connecting Mama Odie with the many orphaned baby opossums that routinely come into the sanctuary's care. The Dodo <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/blind-mama-opossum-cries-out-for-the-sweetest-reason">explains</a> that "Mama Odie immediately embraced them as if they were her own," and <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/blind-mama-opossum-cries-out-for-the-sweetest-reason">quotes</a> MacDougal, who stated: "It's a really beautiful thing to watch. . . [she's] such a loving parent for these babies." MacDougal also described a really cool event that happened between Mama Odie and one orphaned opossum. The Dodo <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/blind-mama-opossum-cries-out-for-the-sweetest-reason">tells the story</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The day the baby opossum arrived at the rehabilitation center, MacDougal noticed something unusual about the way Mama Odie was acting. She was making clicking noises over and over, which opossums only ever do when they're looking for their mate or their babies.</p>

<p>MacDougal checked all over Mama Odie's pen to see what she could possibly be looking for. But she couldn't find anything. Then, she heard a sound she didn't expect coming from across the room.</p>

<p>From the other side of the room, the new baby opossum had been calling out to Mama Odie, and Mama Odie was responding. Somehow, she and the baby had discovered each other and were now asking to be together. So MacDougal decided to try putting the baby with Mama Odie.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turns out they were, as MacDougal exclaimed, "a match made in heaven," as Mama Odie immediately took in the baby and adopted it as her own. The Dodo states that Mama Odie "cleaned him and cuddled with him alongside her other adopted babies."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can see Mama Odie and the orphaned baby clicking to communicate with each other <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQCg-xDCQ4e/">here</a>, and witness their amazing and adorable introduction. At the time of this video, in April 2024, Mama Odie had helped raised five orphans. During her total time at the rescue, she's been a surrogate mama to more than twenty orphaned opossum babies who have successfully been rehabilitated and released back into the wild.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mama Odie is still alive and kicking, I'm happy to report! The rescue posted some <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17QE7nhTrA/">recent photos</a> of her from New Year's Eve, 2025, stating that she's doing well in her old age. She's very fond of her "plush bed," loves being served "healthy meals," and she still adores being "close to babies as much as possible."</p>

<p>During the three decades that the Keeper of the Wild Wildlife Rescue and Sanctuary has operated, they have helped thousands of animals — including Mama Odie and all of her surrogate babies — across nine counties. While many of the animals they rehabilitate are able to be released into the wild, those who are too injured to ever live in the wild again (like Mama Odie) call the sanctuary their forever home.
