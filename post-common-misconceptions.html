<p>Wikipedia maintains a sprawling list of common misconceptions, and it's guaranteed to ruin at least one thing you thought you knew. The bald eagle's majestic scream in movies? That's actually a red-tailed hawk. Bald eagles make soft, chirpy sounds that apparently weren't dramatic enough for Hollywood.</p>

<p>The Egyptian pyramids weren't built by slaves. Archaeological evidence shows the laborers were skilled workers and farmers in the off-season, paid with food and tax exemptions. George Washington's teeth weren't wooden — they were made of lead, gold, hippopotamus ivory, and teeth from horses and donkeys, which is somehow worse.</p>

<p>Medieval adults didn't die at 30. Low life expectancy figures are skewed by infant mortality; a 21-year-old man in medieval England could expect to live to 64. You don't swallow spiders in your sleep (sleeping humans make noises that scare them off). And that 1990s movie Shazaam starring Sinbad as a genie? Never existed. It's a collective false memory so widespread it has its own name: the Mandela effect.</p>

<p>The full Wikipedia list covers hundreds of these, organized by category. It's the perfect thing to browse when you want to feel simultaneously smarter and dumber.</p>
