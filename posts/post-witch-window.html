<p>In Vermont and parts of New England, you'll occasionally spot old farmhouses with windows installed at a 45-degree angle, tucked into the gable end of the roof. These are called "witch windows," and according to local folklore, they're tilted because witches can't fly their broomsticks through a diagonal opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The explanation is delightfully absurd. Why would a witch — capable of flight, presumably wielding dark powers — be foiled by window geometry? But the name has stuck, and the windows are now a beloved quirk of Vermont architecture. Some locals also call them "coffin windows," based on a theory that they were used to slide coffins out of upper floors. Architectural historians find this equally implausible — you wouldn't carry a coffin upstairs to begin with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real explanation is probably more mundane. During the 19th century, rural Vermont had limited access to factory-made windows. If you were building a house, you ordered from a catalog with limited size options. When a standard window didn't fit the narrow space between the roof slope and the wall, resourceful farmers installed it diagonally to maximize both light and available wall space. Others likely reused windows salvaged from older buildings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Witch windows are found almost exclusively in Vermont, making them a genuine regional architectural oddity. They're a reminder that sometimes the most practical solution looks strange enough to spawn supernatural explanations.</p>
