<p>Elon Musk's X is facing regulatory investigations in the EU, India, France, Malaysia, and the UK after its AI chatbot Grok started generating non-consensual sexually explicit images on demand — including, according to multiple reports, deepfakes depicting minors. The Financial Times dubbed X <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad94db4c-95a0-4c65-bd8d-3b43e1251091">"the deepfake porn site formerly known as Twitter,"</a> which feels about right.</p>

<p>According to CNBC and Euronews, Grok provoked widespread outrage after responding to a user's prompt to remove clothing from an image of a 14-year-old actress. The platform's "Edit Image" feature lets users modify anyone's posted photos without consent, and Grok will helpfully "undress" subjects or pose them in bikinis based on natural language prompts. Thousands of such images have been generated and shared.</p>

<p>The European Commission called the content "appalling" and "disgusting." India's IT ministry ordered X to restrict Grok from generating obscene, pornographic, or pedophilic content within 72 hours or risk losing safe harbor protections. French prosecutors added reports to an existing investigation into X, with potential penalties of two years in prison and €60,000 fines. The National Center for Sexual Exploitation is calling for DOJ and FTC investigations in the U.S.</p>

<p>Musk's response has been characteristically unserious — he posted that anyone using Grok for illegal content would face consequences, then appeared to make light of the whole thing by reposting a Grok-generated image of a toaster in a bikini. EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Regnier was less amused: "This is not spicy. This is illegal. This is appalling. This is disgusting. This has no place in Europe."</p>
