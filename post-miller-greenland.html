<p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller appeared on CNN Monday and repeatedly refused to rule out military action against Greenland. According to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/06/stephen-miller-greenland-europe-nato">Axios</a>, when pressed by Jake Tapper, Miller declared: "Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland."</p>

<p>Seizing Greenland by force would be the first time a NATO member directly attacked another member's territory since the alliance was created in 1949. That historical footnote doesn't seem to trouble the administration. Fears of U.S. action spiked after Katie Miller — Stephen Miller's wife and a former Trump official — posted an image of Greenland covered with an American flag on Saturday, captioned "SOON," just hours after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>European leaders responded with a joint statement defending "the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders." Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has issued repeated statements condemning the rhetoric from Washington and requesting respectful dialogue. Polling shows only 6 percent of Greenlanders want to join the U.S., with 86 percent opposed. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was blunt: the United States has "no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom."</p>
