<p>Bill Clinton didn't show up for his subpoenaed deposition in the House Epstein investigation on Monday, and Chairman James Comer says he'll initiate contempt proceedings next week. Hillary's deposition is scheduled for tomorrow. But instead of a dry legal response, the Clintons sent Comer a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/13/us/politics/clinton-legal-letter-comer.html">four-page letter</a> that reads less like a legal filing and more like a declaration of war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This past year has seen our Government engage in unprecedented acts, including against our own citizens," the letter begins, before listing grievances: masked federal agents seizing people from homes, students and scientists deported without due process, January 6 rioters pardoned and called heroes, agencies dismantled, troops deployed on American streets, and "most recently and searingly, an ICE agent killed an unarmed mother only days ago." Every person has to decide when they've had enough, they write. "For us, now is that time."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the actual investigation, the Clintons note they've already provided written answers covering the same ground as seven of the eight other subpoenaed individuals — none of whom Comer forced to appear. They point out that only four Republicans, out of 220, joined Democrats to force a vote on DOJ releasing the Epstein files. "You accepted the least from those who know the most," they write, "but demand the most from those who know the least."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter ends with a threat: "Continue to abet the dismantling of America, and you will learn that it takes more than a wrecking ball to demolish what Americans have built over 250 years." Contempt charges could mean up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-hillary-clinton-house-oversight-committee-epstein-investigation-contempt-of-congress/">reports CBS News</a>.</p>
