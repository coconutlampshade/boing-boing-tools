<p>Drivers on Interstate 480 can't miss the <a href="https://sculpturecenter.org/oosi/items/show/1688">playful trio of hot-pink towers</a> rising from the Malley's Chocolates complex in Brook Park, Ohio. Each silo is boldly labeled "Cocoa," "Milk," and "Sugar." They stand beside the company's main chocolate-making facility and retail store. Inside, the shop is washed in a signature pink known to employees as "Malley pink" — a color closely resembling Baker-Miller pink, a shade once studied for its calming psychological effects.</p>

<p>"Malley's has been a local institution since opening their first, much more modest shop in Lakewood in 1935. Erected at Brook Park in 2011, the silos each measure 12 feet wide and 88 feet tall, and can hold up to 100,000 pounds of raw material. Malley's originally planned to use them to store milk, cocoa, and sugar, which would have been moved into the building through an underground vacuum pipe system, but they wound up scrapping that plan before the silos were fully installed."</p>

<p>The silos have become a local landmark. People use them to navigate while driving. I'm glad they've stayed up, even though they're out of use. They're the perfect shade of pink.</p>
