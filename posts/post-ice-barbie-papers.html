<p>DHS Secretary Kristi Noem — dubbed "ICE Barbie" for her habit of cosplaying in tactical gear during immigration raids — now says Americans should expect to prove their citizenship during ICE operations, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-barbie-warns-americans-must-be-prepared-to-prove-citizenship/">reports The Daily Beast</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there and validate their identity," Noem told reporters outside the White House. "That's what we've always done."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This comes days after video captured ICE agents violently detaining two Target employees in Minnesota. One worker could be heard saying he was a citizen as agents threw him to the ground. A state lawmaker confirmed both were U.S. citizens. When asked if she was okay with federal agents violating Fourth Amendment rights by demanding papers without reasonable suspicion, Noem deflected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement also follows ICE shooting and killing Renee Good, a mother of three and legal observer monitoring federal enforcement in Minneapolis. DHS called her actions "domestic terrorism." Protests have erupted nationwide. Noem shows no intention of resigning, and instead joined agents on the ground Tuesday for "Operation Midway Blitz" — another photo op in tactical cosplay while Americans wonder if they need to carry a passport to go to Target.</p>
