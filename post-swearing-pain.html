<p>Researchers at Keele University have proven what stubbed-toe sufferers have long known: swearing actually helps with pain. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalgesic_effect_of_swearing">Wikipedia</a>, in a 2009 study published in NeuroReport, Richard Stephens and colleagues found that subjects could hold their hands in ice water for twice as long while swearing compared to using neutral words. They also reported feeling less pain. Stephens' professional advice: "I would advise people, if they hurt themselves, to swear."</p>

<p>The effect appears to work through disinhibition. Swearing may activate the amygdala, triggering a fight-or-flight response and a surge of adrenaline — a natural painkiller. But there's a catch: people who swear regularly don't get the same benefit. A 2011 follow-up study showed that frequent swearers demonstrated little or no improvement in pain tolerance. The emotional charge matters. If you drop f-bombs every sentence, they lose their power when you need them most.</p>

<p>Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker suggested in The Stuff of Thought that "humans are hardwired to swear cathartically... Swearing probably comes from a very primitive reflex that evolved in animals." The research has been replicated on MythBusters and in Stephen Fry's documentary Fry's Planet Word. Stephens and his team won the 2010 Ig Nobel Peace Prize for their work.</p>

<p>Later research from Massey University found swearing reduces psychological pain too — people reported emotionally distressing memories as less painful after letting loose with profanity. The science is clear: save your swearing for when you really need it.</p>
