<article id="postBody">
<p>Polymarket is refusing to settle approximately $10.5 million in bets on whether the U.S. would invade Venezuela, arguing that the military operation to capture Nicolás Maduro doesn't count as an "invasion." According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/985ae542-1ab4-491e-8e6e-b30f6a3ab666">the Financial Times</a>, the prediction market claims the contract specifically required "US military operations intended to establish control" over Venezuelan territory, and a "snatch-and-extract" mission followed by diplomatic engagements doesn't meet that standard.</p>

<p>Traders are furious. "That a military incursion, the kidnapping of a head of state, and the takeover of a country are not classified as an invasion is plainly absurd," one user wrote. Another called the platform "Polyscam," posting: "Polymarket has degenerated into sheer arbitrary judgment. Words are redefined at will, detached from any accepted meaning."</p>

<p>The dispute comes alongside suspicious trading activity that's drawn congressional attention. One account made only 13 bets totaling about $34,000 between December 27 and January 3 — all related to whether the U.S. would invade Venezuela or remove Maduro. By Sunday, that account had raked in over $409,000. Congressman Ritchie Torres plans to propose legislation barring insiders from trading on prediction market contracts tied to sensitive political or military events.</p>

<p>Prediction markets have been pitched as superior to polls and pundits for forecasting real-world events. That claim gets harder to defend when the house can apparently decide after the fact what counts as an "invasion."</p>
