<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 17, 1967, Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt went for a swim at Cheviot Beach in Victoria. He walked into the rough surf and disappeared. His body was never found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holt was 59 and an experienced swimmer who'd been swimming at that beach for years. The conditions that day were dangerous — heavy surf and a strong undertow — but Holt went in anyway while friends watched from shore. Within minutes he was gone. The search that followed was one of the largest in Australian history, involving helicopters, divers, and naval vessels. Nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most likely explanation is simply that the ocean killed him. But the absence of a body spawned decades of conspiracy theories. Some claimed he faked his death. Others insisted he was picked up by a Chinese submarine — Holt had been a vocal supporter of the Vietnam War and opponent of communism. A 2005 biography argued he committed suicide. The coroner's 2005 inquest concluded he drowned accidentally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most Australian detail of this whole saga: two years after his disappearance, the government opened the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in Melbourne. Naming a swimming pool after a man who drowned strikes many as darkly ironic, though supporters argue Holt loved swimming and would have appreciated the tribute. Either way, it's a very Australian way to remember a Prime Minister.</p>
