<p>A 21-year-old protester will never see out of his left eye again after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a "nonlethal" round into his face at close range during a demonstration in Santa Ana on January 9. According to the LA Times and other outlets, the young man underwent six hours of surgery. Doctors found shards of plastic, glass, and metal embedded in his eyes and face — including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from his carotid artery that surgeons were afraid to remove because it could kill him.</p>

<p>The protest was part of nationwide demonstrations against ICE following the fatal shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis. Video from the scene shows an officer grabbing a demonstrator who appeared to be standing peacefully, dragging him up the steps of the federal building. When someone in the crowd threw a traffic cone, officers opened fire on protesters. After being shot in the face, the 21-year-old was grabbed by the hood of his sweatshirt and dragged across the ground.</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to bleed out on the floor of the federal building with a DHS agent holding my head down to the ground like a trophy," the victim said. His skull was fractured around his eyes and nose.</p>

<p>DHS offered a different account, describing "a mob of about 60 rioters" who "threw rocks, bottles and fireworks" and calling it "a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields." Two protesters were arrested for assault on a federal officer. The administration that killed Renee Good in her own home is now permanently disfiguring people who object to it.</p>
