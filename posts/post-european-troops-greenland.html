<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden are sending troops to Greenland, with approximately 15 French mountain infantry soldiers already in Nuuk and a 13-person German reconnaissance team deploying Thursday, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/15/g-s1-106113/european-troops-arrive-greenland">reports NPR</a>. Denmark is also ramping up its own military presence on the Arctic island it has governed for centuries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deployments come one day after Danish and Greenlandic officials met with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House — a meeting that ended with what Denmark's foreign minister called a "fundamental disagreement" over Trump's designs on the territory. Trump has justified his interest by claiming "if we don't go in, Russia is going to go in and China is going in."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sudden European military coordination sends a clear message: NATO allies aren't about to let one member annex another's territory just because the president wants it. A U.S.-Denmark working group has been established to address Arctic security concerns while respecting Danish sovereignty — diplomatic speak for "we're taking this seriously but not handing over the island." Local Greenlanders, meanwhile, have pointed out that the dispute seems less about security and more about Greenland's untapped oil and mineral wealth. Only 6% of Greenlanders want to join the U.S., with 86% opposed.</p>
