<p>Vice President JD Vance responded to the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis by blaming her for her own death. According to Newsweek, Vance posted on social media: "You can accept that this woman's death is a tragedy while acknowledging it's a tragedy of her own making. Don't illegally interfere in federal law enforcement operations and try to run over our officers with your car. It's really that simple."</p>

<p>In a press conference, Vance doubled down. He said the ICE agent who shot Good was doing an "important job for the United States of America" and noted that the agent had been dragged by a suspect's vehicle in a previous incident. "So you think maybe he's a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?" Vance said.</p>

<p>Good was a U.S. citizen, a widow, and the mother of three children. Local officials say she was acting as a legal observer during ICE's enforcement operation — what DHS called the largest immigration sweep ever conducted. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz have both contradicted the federal account of events, with Frey calling DHS's characterization "bullshit" and Walz warning Minnesotans not to trust the "propaganda machine."</p>

<p>DHS, meanwhile, labeled Good a "violent rioter" who committed "an act of domestic terrorism" by "weaponizing her vehicle."</p>
