<p>Anyone who values online privacy owes a debt to <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/08/01/a-profile-of-moxie-marlinspike.html">Moxie Marlinspike</a>, the cryptographic genius behind <a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/02/01/a-glimpse-at-the-messy-future-of-signal-the-popular-encrypted-messaging-app.html">Signal</a> — the encrypted messaging app that drives <a href="https://boingboing.net/2013/06/12/moxie-marlinspike-on-the-nsa-s.html">snooping governments</a> and data-hungry corporations batshit crazy. Signal's had a damn good run. Now Marlinspike wants to bring the same security to AI, which has traditionally offered zero privacy. <a href="https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/confessions-to-a-data-lake/">He's calling his platform Confer</a>:</p>

<p>I've been building Confer: end-to-end encryption for AI chats. With Confer, your conversations are encrypted so that nobody else can see them. Confer can't read them, train on them, or hand them over – because only you have access to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The core idea is that your conversations with an AI assistant should be as private as your conversations with a person. Not because you're doing something wrong, but because privacy is what lets you think freely.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marlinspike's <a href="https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/confessions-to-a-data-lake/">post</a> is worth reading. His argument: if a messaging app makes your conversation appear private, users should actually get privacy. The chat interface we use to talk to LLMs feels intimate — but your data is anything but private. AI companies are still begging, borrowing, and stealing every bit of information they can to train their models. Confer could offer an alternative to the current data free-for-all.</p>

<p>Confer has been in testing with a small group for the past few weeks.</p>
