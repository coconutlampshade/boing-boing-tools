<p>With ICE agents detaining U.S. citizens at Target stores and demanding papers from Americans, it's worth understanding what legal authority they actually have. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/15/ice-authority-arrest-us-citizens/">Snopes dug into the law</a>, and the answer is: less than they're exercising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under 8 U.S. Code § 1357, ICE agents can arrest citizens without a warrant only if the agent is actively performing immigration duties, the citizen is committing a federal offense, and there's likelihood the person will escape before a warrant is obtained. That's a narrow window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's the key distinction: judicial warrants, signed by judges, can authorize arrest of citizens — but ICE rarely bothers to get them. Instead, they use administrative warrants signed by ICE officials themselves. "ICE has no administrative warrant powers over U.S. citizens," said immigration attorney Sarah Owings. Another attorney, Nathan Yaffe, put it bluntly: ICE "is basically giving itself permission."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet ICE has reportedly detained and deported numerous U.S. citizens in 2025, including children born in the United States. The gap between ICE's legal authority and its actual behavior is vast — and growing. When agents flash an administrative warrant at a citizen, they're relying on the person not knowing the document has no legal power over them.</p>
