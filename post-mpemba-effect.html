<p>The Mpemba effect sounds like it should be easy to debunk: hot water freezing faster than cold water? That's backwards. But under certain conditions, it actually happens, and physicists have been arguing about why for decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effect is named after Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian teenager who noticed it in the 1960s while making ice cream. His teacher dismissed him, but Mpemba persisted and eventually collaborated with physicist Denis Osborne to study it properly. Their 1969 paper confirmed the phenomenon was real, even if the mechanism remained unclear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proposed explanations include evaporation (hot water loses mass faster), dissolved gases (hot water holds less air), convection currents, supercooling effects, and differences in hydrogen bonding. None of these fully accounts for all observations. Some researchers question whether the effect is even consistently reproducible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whole situation is a humbling reminder that even basic physics can surprise us. We've mapped the human genome and detected gravitational waves, but we still can't fully explain why your hot tea might freeze before your cold water. Wikipedia dives deep into the competing theories.</p>
