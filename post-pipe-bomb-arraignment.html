<p>Brian Cole Jr., the Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters the night before January 6, pleaded not guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The 30-year-old has been detained since his arrest in December, when the FBI finally took someone into custody for a crime that went unsolved for nearly five years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to CNN, prosecutors say Cole placed the bombs on the night of January 5, 2021. Their discovery the next morning diverted law enforcement resources as rioters supporting Trump disrupted the certification of the 2020 election. Cole told FBI agents after his arrest that he believed the election was stolen — offering a possible motive — while also claiming he had "disagreements with both political parties."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole's defense attorneys argue the devices could never have exploded and say their client has been "entirely peaceful" and follows a strict routine due to diagnoses that include autism. They're trying to get the federal judge to review the decision to keep him detained. His next hearing is scheduled for January 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The case drew intense scrutiny because the investigation remained open for so long, fueling conspiracy theories. Surveillance footage showed a masked individual placing the devices, but authorities didn't publicly identify a suspect until Cole's arrest last month.</p>
