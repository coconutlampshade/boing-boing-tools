<article id="postBody">
<p>In 1718, British inventor James Puckle patented what may have been the world's first machine gun — a tripod-mounted, hand-cranked flintlock with a revolving cylinder that could fire multiple shots without reloading. A shipping manifest from 1722 actually called it a "machine gun," though it bore little resemblance to later automatic weapons. It was intended as an anti-boarding gun for ships.</p>

<p>The gun came in two versions. The standard model fired conventional round bullets. The second model fired square bullets, which were considered more painful and would cause worse wounds. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckle_gun">Puckle's patent</a>, the square ammunition was specifically designed for use against Ottoman Turks, to "convince the Turks of the benefits of Christian civilization."</p>

<p>Whether Puckle was serious or engaging in dark marketing humor is unclear, but the patent is real. The gun itself barely existed — as few as two were ever made, and it was never used in combat. A 1722 demonstration for investors failed to generate orders. The British military wasn't interested.</p>

<p>One observer wrote that the Puckle gun had "only one fault, that of being a weapon contrived to do too much." The technology was ahead of its time but too complex, too expensive, and too unreliable for 18th-century manufacturing. The revolving cylinder concept wouldn't catch on for another century. As for whether square bullets actually hurt more than round ones, nobody ever found out in practice.</p>
