<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban immigrant, died on January 3 at Camp Montana East, an ICE detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso. The Department of Homeland Security initially said he experienced "medical distress." The El Paso County medical examiner found something more specific: asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A witness told the Associated Press that guards handcuffed Lunas Campos, tackled him, and placed him in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. After the AP started asking questions, DHS amended its story, now claiming he was attempting suicide and "violently resisted" staff. The medical examiner is expected to classify the death as a homicide, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-immigration-detention-death-texas-2bfb614b2b222803d309f338357d04eb">reports the AP</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lunas Campos had lived in the United States for more than two decades. He arrived legally in 1996 as part of a wave of Cuban immigrants and was living in Rochester, New York when ICE arrested him. He was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, a $1.2 billion tent facility in the desert that the AP previously reported is operated by Acquisition Logistics LLC — a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Virginia with no prior experience running a corrections facility.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four people have died in ICE detention in just the first two weeks of 2026. Last year was the deadliest on record. The detention population has ballooned to 70,000 immigrants.</p>
