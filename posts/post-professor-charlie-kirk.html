<article id="postBody">
<p>Darren Michael, an associate professor at Austin Peay State University, has been reinstated and will receive $500,000 after the school fired him for sharing a news headline about Charlie Kirk. According to <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/professor-fired-for-charlie-kirk-post-gets-500000-from-school-is-reinstated/">Mediaite</a>, Michael shared an article headlined "Charlie Kirk says gun deaths are 'unfortunately' worth it to keep 2nd Amendment" — without adding any commentary of his own.</p>

<p>Two days after Kirk's assassination in September 2025, APSU terminated Michael, with President Mike Licari citing "insensitive comments" that "do not align with Austin Peay's commitment to mutual respect and human dignity." Senator Marsha Blackburn amplified the post on social media, including Michael's photo and biography, drawing public attention to his account.</p>

<p>The problem: APSU didn't follow its own tenure termination process. The settlement includes the $500,000 payment, reimbursement for therapeutic counseling, and reinstatement effective December 2025. The university issued a statement acknowledging it "did not follow the required termination process in this matter" and expressing "deep regret" for "the impact this has had on Professor Michael."</p>

<p>Michael shared a factual headline from a news outlet. He didn't celebrate anything or add commentary. The university fired him anyway, apparently responding to political pressure rather than any policy violation, then had to pay half a million dollars when it turned out that tenured professors have contractual rights that don't disappear because a senator got mad online.</p>
