<p>Many anthropologists argue that cultures that <a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/05/24/university-cafeteria-officially-named-after-killer-cannibal.html">engage in cannibalism</a> rarely do so because of food shortages. Rather, it's an act often rooted in faith: practitioners believe that by eating the brains, eyes, or hearts of other humans, they take on their spirit, strength, or knowledge. Recently, it's started becoming common to use the bits and pieces of the dead to take on other attributes as well: a more socially acceptable face or ass, for example.</p>

<p>A company called <a href="https://tiger-aesthetics.com">Tiger Aesthetics</a> has come up with a new plastic surgery procedure that uses body fat from cadavers to plump up breasts, bums, and other bits that need a bit of filling out—a surprisingly brisk market given the success of weight loss drugs like Ozempic. The treatment is called alloClae and can cost as much as $100,000 for each session. One of the most significant advantages of alloClae over conventional plastic surgery procedures, like breast augmentation with silicone implants, is that it doesn't require general anesthesia. It also has a vastly shorter recovery time. So those who can afford to pump themselves full of the Crisco of the Dead can get right back to making mad stacks as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Business Insider has the goods on these <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plastic-surgery-fat-from-dead-people-alloclae-corporate-ozempic-2025-12">Bodies by Zombies</a>. It's a hell of a read. Apparently, no one lining up for alloClae has ever watched a B-horror movie. This sort of shit is how someone like Dr. Giggles gets his hooks into you.</p>
