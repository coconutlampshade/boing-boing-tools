<p>About 41,000 years ago, Earth's magnetic field did something alarming: it flipped. The magnetic poles swapped places during an event called the Laschamps reversal, and the protective field that shields us from cosmic radiation dropped to just 5% of its normal strength. Scientists have now turned this ancient catastrophe into audio, and it sounds like the planet groaning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark and the German Research Center for Geosciences created the sonification using satellite data from the European Space Agency's Swarm mission, combined with evidence from French lava flows that recorded the event. The resulting track features creaking wood and crashing rocks — natural sounds mapped to the field's chaotic movements, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/earths-flipping-magnetic-field-heard-140025309.html">reports Yahoo News</a>.</p>

<p>The reversal itself took about 250 years to complete, with the field staying inverted for another 440 years before flipping back. During that window, Earth's weakened defenses let cosmic rays pour into the atmosphere, doubling levels of beryllium-10 isotopes in ice and ocean sediments. Some researchers think the event contributed to Australian megafauna extinctions and may have changed how humans used caves.</p>

<p>The Swarm satellites have been monitoring Earth's magnetic field since 2013, tracking anomalies like a weakening zone over the Atlantic. Scientists say that doesn't necessarily mean another reversal is coming — but if you want to hear what one sounds like, now you can.</p>
