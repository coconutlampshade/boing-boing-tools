<p>President Trump addressed House Republicans at their annual retreat on Monday — held at the Kennedy Center, recently renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by its Trump-appointed board — with a warning: win the midterms or watch him get impeached for a third time. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/trump-warns-he-ll-be-impeached-if-republicans-don-t-win-midterms">Bloomberg</a>, Trump told the assembled lawmakers, "You got to win the midterms, because if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be — I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me."</p>

<p>The timing was notable: Trump delivered these remarks on the fifth anniversary of January 6, just days after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Speaker Mike Johnson has been pushing the same message, telling supporters at Turning Point USA's America Fest last month that if Republicans lose the House, "the radical left is going to impeach President Trump. They're going to create absolute chaos."</p>

<p>Trump remains the only president in U.S. history to be impeached twice — first for abuse of power involving Ukraine, then for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. The Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him both times. Current Polymarket odds put the chances of a third impeachment by end of 2026 at 12 percent, up from 5 percent after last month's Epstein document release. The president's party almost always loses seats in midterm elections — a historical pattern that clearly weighs on the administration.</p>
