<h1>Pentagon sends angry letters to Toronto sex shop over Bahrain shipments</h1>

<p>A Toronto sexual wellness retailer called Bonjibon has received some unusual correspondence: strongly worded letters from the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command demanding they stop shipping adult products to military personnel stationed in Bahrain. According to <a href="https://www.cp24.com/local/toronto/2026/01/06/stop-sending-butt-plugs-to-bahrain-toronto-sex-store-receives-letters-from-us-department-of-war/">CP24</a>, the Pentagon intercepted packages containing sex toys during customs screening at a naval base, and someone felt compelled to write a formal complaint about it.</p>

<p>The letters, sent over roughly a month during summer 2025, informed the shop that "pornographic materials and or devices were identified" in packages addressed to service members. Bahrain law strictly prohibits sex toys and pornographic materials, and U.S. Transportation Command explicitly lists such items as shipping violations to the kingdom — right alongside handcuffs and nudity magazines.</p>

<p>Bonjibon co-founder Grace Bennett discovered the letters while processing returned shipments affected by Trump-era tariffs and the elimination of de minimis exemptions. The packages had been opened, inspected, and repacked before making their way back to Canada. Bennett's response was delightfully unbothered: "I don't know why they're sending me very cross letters saying, 'Stop sending items that could cause bodily harm to this country.' This sounds like a you problem."</p>

<p>The customers got refunds. The two Pentagon letters now hang framed — bedazzled, naturally — in Bonjibon's offices in Toronto and British Columbia. It's not every day a sex shop gets official correspondence from the Department of Defense about their product line.</p>
