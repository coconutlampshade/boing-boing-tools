<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That wallet on the sidewalk, the phone left on a park bench, the bicycle seemingly abandoned in an alley — taking any of these could land you a criminal charge. It's called "theft by finding," and it exists in various forms across legal systems worldwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crime occurs when someone finds an object that appears abandoned and takes it without making reasonable efforts to locate the owner. The key question is whether the item was truly abandoned or merely lost or unattended. An unlocked car isn't abandoned. Neither is a bag sitting outside a café. Even if no owner is in sight, you're generally required to attempt to find them or turn the item over to authorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different jurisdictions call it different things — "larceny by finding" or "stealing by finding" — but the principle is consistent: the childhood rule of "finders keepers, losers weepers" doesn't hold up in court. The law generally presumes that lost items have owners who want them back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wikipedia's article on theft by finding explains the legal nuances across different countries. The short version: if you find something valuable, your safest move is to turn it in. Pocketing it is a gamble that the law says you'll probably lose.</p>
