<p>The Hoba meteorite weighs about 60 metric tons and has never been moved. It lies on a farm in Namibia, right where it fell roughly 80,000 years ago. It's the largest known intact meteorite on Earth, and it's still just sitting there because moving 60 tons of iron is really, really hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A farmer discovered it in 1920 when his plow struck something that shouldn't have been there. The object turned out to be a flat-topped chunk of iron and nickel about 2.7 meters across and one meter thick — roughly the size and shape of a small car crushed into a pancake. Scientists estimate it originally weighed around 66 tons before weathering and souvenir hunters chipped away at it.</p>

<p>What's strange about Hoba is that there's no impact crater. Meteorites this size usually leave a mark. The leading theory is that Hoba's flat shape and the Earth's atmosphere conspired to slow it down significantly before impact — essentially a cosmic belly flop that distributed the force enough to avoid cratering. It may have also skipped across the atmosphere like a stone on water before finally touching down.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The site is now a national monument. Visitors can walk right up and touch a 60-ton chunk of space debris that's older than human civilization. The government built a small amphitheater around it. You can sit on stone benches and contemplate a rock that traveled through the void for billions of years only to end up as a tourist attraction on a Namibian farm.</p>
