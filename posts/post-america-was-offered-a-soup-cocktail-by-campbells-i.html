TITLE: Campbell's tried to make soup cocktails happen in 1955
AUTHOR: Popkin

CONTENT:
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These 1955 advertisements show Campbell's Soup pushing an unexpected <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTdpcOck4u2/?img_index=2">cocktail recipe</a>. One ad gives the recipe for a "Frisky Sour": 2 chilled cans of Campbell's Beef Broth, 1 can of ice water, and 1/3 cup of fresh lemon juice. At first glance, I thought these recipes were meant to jazz up cold Campbell's soup with something fun. But these cocktail recipes don't call for any alcohol. They're basically just instructions on how to distract yourself with a dash of lemon juice from the fact that you're drinking cold Campbell's soup.</p>

<p>"In August 1955, Campbell's Soup rolled out a splashy ad for its savory "cocktail" in LIFE magazine.</p>

<p>More ads soon followed, along with promotional gifts of Soup on the Rocks to actors and athletes. Whether they actually enjoyed it, however...we may never know."</p>
