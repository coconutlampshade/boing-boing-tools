<p>TJ Sabula, the Ford factory worker who called Trump a "pedophile protector" during a plant tour in Dearborn, Michigan, has raised over $440,000 on GoFundMe after being suspended without pay, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2026/01/14/over-280000-raised-for-ford-worker-suspended-for-calling-trump-pedophile-protector/">reports Click On Detroit</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Video captured Trump mouthing "fuck you" and flipping off the 40-year-old UAW line worker before continuing his tour. The White House defended Trump's gesture as "an appropriate and unambiguous response" to what it called "wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage." Sabula told the Washington Post he has "no regrets whatsoever."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The United Auto Workers union threw its support behind Sabula. "Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States," said the director of the UAW Ford Department. Rep. Rashida Tlaib confirmed Ford suspended Sabula without pay after Trump pointed at him and said "you're fired."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sabula's "pedophile protector" comment referenced Trump's documented connections to Jeffrey Epstein and the administration's handling of a law requiring the FBI to release related files. The GoFundMe haul suggests plenty of people agree with his assessment — or at least appreciate someone saying it to Trump's face.</p>
