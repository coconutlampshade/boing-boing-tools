<p>Running your own home server used to mean spending hours fighting with Docker configs, memorizing arcane Linux commands, and debugging networking issues at 2am. Developer Jordan Fulghum <a href="https://fulghum.io/self-hosting">argues that 2026 is the inflection point</a> where that changed — and the reason is CLI agents like Claude Code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitch: a $379 Beelink mini PC, an 8TB NVMe drive, and an AI assistant that actually knows how to configure things. Fulghum now runs 14 containerized services — Vaultwarden for passwords, Immich as a Google Photos replacement, Plex, Home Assistant, and more — all while his tiny server idles at under 10% CPU. Total hardware cost: around $700.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real innovation isn't the hardware, which has been cheap for years. It's that you no longer need to become a sysadmin to make it work. When Fulghum needs to set up a reverse proxy or configure automatic backups to AWS Glacier, he just asks Claude Code to handle it. The agent reads documentation, writes configs, and troubleshoots errors — all the tedious parts that used to make self-hosting a chore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daily backups go to an external USB drive; weekly backups upload to Glacier for about 20 cents a month. The whole system runs through Tailscale for secure remote access without opening ports to the internet. For anyone comfortable with a terminal but tired of paying for a dozen SaaS subscriptions, this might be the moment self-hosting finally makes sense.</p>
