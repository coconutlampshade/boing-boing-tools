<p>We've all been trapped near someone blasting videos on their phone in public — the airport gate, the train car, the waiting room. Developer Pankaj Tanwar got fed up with exactly this situation at Bombay airport and built a delightfully petty solution: a web app called STFU that weaponizes delayed auditory feedback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept is simple but effective. Point your phone at the offender, and the app captures audio through your microphone, then plays it back about 200 milliseconds later. This tiny delay creates a phenomenon called delayed auditory feedback, which messes with the brain's speech processing in ways that make it genuinely difficult to keep talking. It's the same principle behind apps designed to help people who stutter, just deployed for chaos.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tanwar <a href="https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/stfu">built the whole thing</a> using Claude AI, and says it worked on the first prompt. The entire project is just HTML using the Web Audio API — no complex dependencies, no installation, just open the website and start creating cognitive dissonance. The MIT license means you can do whatever you want with it.</p>

<p>Will pointing your phone at a stranger and blasting their own voice back at them create an awkward confrontation? Almost certainly. Is it passive-aggressive in the extreme? Absolutely. But sometimes you're on hour three of a layover and someone is watching TikToks at full volume, and desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
