<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former South Carolina state representative RJ May, a 39-year-old Republican from Lexington County who served as vice chair of the conservative South Carolina Freedom Caucus, was sentenced Wednesday to 17.5 years in federal prison for distributing child sexual abuse material.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing CSAM. While actively serving as a lawmaker, he used the messaging app Kik under aliases including "joebidennnn69" and "Eric Rentling" to send videos of child sexual abuse to other users, <a href="https://www.wistv.com/2026/01/14/ex-sc-rep-rj-may-be-sentenced-federal-child-sexual-abuse-material-charges/">reports WIS-TV</a>. Federal prosecutors said he distributed nearly 500 explicit videos over just five days in late March and early April 2024, sharing material with users in 18 states and six countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The judge noted the videos involved "more severe" abuse than she had encountered in other cases. Investigators found May's account contained 265 videos and nearly 1,150 messages exchanged with other users discussing trading such material. Court documents revealed May also engaged in conversations with women from Colombia about arranging sexual encounters, and that his activity indicated "a sexual interest in children the same age as his own children."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May had argued for a shorter prison term followed by house arrest on his family's Virginia farm. He got 17.5 years instead. He represented Lexington County starting in 2021 and was re-elected in November 2024 even after his indictment, finally resigning in August 2025.</p>
