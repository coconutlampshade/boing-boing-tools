<p>ICE agents detained four Oglala Lakota men in South Minneapolis and transported three of them to Fort Snelling — a site that served as a concentration camp during the forced removal of Dakota people in the 1860s, <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/north-central-bureau/four-oglala-detainees-located-three-still-in-ice-custody/">reports ICT News</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One detainee has been released. Three remain in custody. The Oglala Sioux Tribe is demanding their immediate release, along with written assurances that ICE will stop detaining Native Americans who are citizens of sovereign tribal nations with treaty rights predating the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The irony is not lost on us," said Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out. "Lakota citizens...at Fort Snelling — a site forever tied to the Dakota 38+2." He's referring to the 38 Dakota men executed in the largest mass hanging in U.S. history, plus two more killed later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tribe characterized the detentions as violating federal law, treaties, and constitutional protections. They're refusing to enter any immigration agreements with ICE or Homeland Security and demanding government-to-government consultation. An enrollment office pop-up was scheduled for January 16-17 to help tribal members obtain documentation — though as citizens of a sovereign nation with treaty rights, they shouldn't need to prove anything to immigration enforcement in the first place.</p>
