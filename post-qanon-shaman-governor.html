<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very few images in modern politics have resonated like that of Jacob Chansley, better known as the QAnon Shaman, storming through the halls of power in his idiotic hat. He was the face of a conspiracy-fueled right-wing insurrection we're still feeling the effects of five years later — so why do we keep giving him chances to worm his way back into politics?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple of years ago, he <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/11/14/the-qanon-shaman-is-running-for-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unsuccessfully ran for Congress</a>. After that, he <a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/10/03/qanon-shaman-sues-trump-for-40-trillion-and-declares-himself-the-rightful-president-of-the-united-states.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared himself President of the United States</a> and sued Donald Trump for $40 trillion — representing either worsening mental illness, increasing desperation in his grift, or both. Now he's lowered his scope to a single state. Congratulations, Arizonans: the QAnon Shaman wants to be your governor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cleaning up his image and presenting himself as a reasonable candidate seems like a flat impossibility, but he's trying. In a recent interview with The Times, Chansley broke down what makes him qualified, at least in his own estimation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now aged 38, Angeli has decisively rejected Trump and says he will run for governor of his home state of Arizona this November as an independent to fight back against a system that is "at war" with its general population in favour of the super-wealthy elite. "All warfare is based on deception and the American people have had war declared on them," Angeli said in a phone interview with The Times. He confirmed his legal name is Jacob Angeli-Chansley but he prefers to be known as Jake Angeli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Since I'm one of the only people that seem to have their wits about them and understand what's actually going on in the world, it is up to me, as far as I'm concerned, to do something about these problems," he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His assertion that he, of all people, has his wits about him is presented without comment. Maybe he and Kyle Langford, the incel running for California governor, can join forces to unite the very worst this country has to offer.</p>
