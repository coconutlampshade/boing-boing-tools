<p>Between 1838 and 1841, a teenager named Edward Jones broke into Buckingham Palace not once, not twice, but at least three times — and Victorian England had absolutely no idea what to do with him, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_boy_Jones">according to Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones was 14 when he first got in, squeezing through a chimney and wandering the palace covered in soot and bear's grease. Staff found him with stolen trousers, a sword, and a portrait of Queen Victoria. At trial, his lawyer argued the boy simply had "an inordinate curiosity to obtain a view of Buckingham Palace" — a "very natural inclination" — and he was acquitted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years later, he was back. This time he scaled a wall on Constitution Hill, entered through a window, and hid under a sofa in the room next to where Victoria had given birth just ten days earlier. When discovered, he told police he'd "sat upon the throne, saw the Queen, and heard the Princess Royal cry." The Privy Council — the monarch's formal body of advisers — interrogated him personally. He explained he wanted to write a book about how royals lived. They gave him three months hard labor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two weeks after his release, he broke in again and was caught eating food from the larders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The authorities were baffled. Jones wasn't violent, didn't steal much, and seemed motivated purely by curiosity. Their solution: the Thames Police secretly pressured him into becoming a sailor, shipping him to Brazil and eventually pressing him into the Royal Navy for six years. He deserted twice. After leaving the service, he was arrested for burglary and transported to Australia, where he likely spent the rest of his life — possibly as a town crier in Perth, tormented by children asking about the Queen.</p>
