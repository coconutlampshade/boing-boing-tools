<p>Outside of the world of open source computing, it's getting pretty hard to escape artificial intelligence being jammed down our throats for use in even the most banal tasks. <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/05/15/algorithmic-cruelty-when-gmai.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google's Gmail</a> was already awful—it watches what you type, what you buy and who you correspond with in the name of monetization. Somehow, they've found a way to make it even worse: you're no longer expected to read the messages that folks send you: artificial intelligence will do that light lift for you, making sure that your brain moves one step closer to resembling pottage. In a<a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gmail/gmail-is-entering-the-gemini-era/"> blog post</a>—likely not written by AI, because LLMs are shit at conveying anything meaningful—Gmail's vice president of product flailed his arms around like a damn Muppet, declaring,</p>

<p>"…email has changed considerably since Gmail launched in 2004. With email volume at an all-time high, managing your inbox and the flow of information has become as important as the emails themselves. To help, we're bringing Gmail into the Gemini era and making it your personal, proactive inbox assistant."</p>

<p>The key reason that email has changed so much in the past two decades is that people like Barnes keep fucking with it. It's no longer enough to keep in touch or have a Nigerian prince offer us millions in exchange for our services. Our names, gender and age get sucked out of what we write. This is made worse by linking any social media we use, dating or shopping sites and the like to your email address. Sign up for a doll foot fetish site (you know it's likely a thing) and, with very few exceptions, your email provider is gonna know about it and share it for profit. Injecting AI into the mix is just one more way to profit from our information.</p>

<p>If it hasn't hit already, Gmail users will be seeing a new Terms of Service disclaimer and be forced to agree with it before they're able to continue to use their account. Once permission's been given, the pillaging will begin in earnest. Google and other free email providers already have their way with our data. Google's party line is that Using AI will make our time reading our email more productive. It'll do this by summarizing what we're sent and helping us to prune our messages down for others to read. Want to kill your ability to read and write anything more than a bullet point? This is how to get there. We already know that this technology is making us stupid like a murder of MAGAs. If you give a LLM even more access to your information, teach it to better ape human speech and writing and, put more people out of work, allowing crap like this will certainly help things along.</p>
